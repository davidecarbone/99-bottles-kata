# 99 Bottles of Beer

99 Bottles of Beer is an algorithmic children's song which has just enough
complexity to teach you deep truths about object oriented programming.

These are companion exercises to the book https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles
The book uses Ruby, however the ideas are applicable to many languages.

Each exercise consists of a test suite. No implementation is provided.
This is intentional, as we believe that there is value in spending 30 minutes writing your own solution before progressing through the exercises in the book.

## Source

The implementations of this exercise come from Exercism (http://exercism.io).

## Contributing

If you wish to add the exercise in programming languages other than those
listed below, please add them in their respective language tracks on Exercism
(https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/you-can-help/implement-an-exercise-from-specification.md).

If the language track does not exist (yet), you can request that a new track
be added by opening an issue in https://github.com/exercism/request-new-language-track.
